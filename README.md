# [Spy Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_Hunter) - a classic arcade-style racing game

Spy Hunter is a simple yet challenging racing game inspired by the classic arcade games of the 80s and 90s. In this game, the player drives a car along a straight road, dodging obstacles, shooting down other cars, and collecting points.

This project is a university assignment for the "Programming Fundamentals" course, and it implements all the mandatory features listed in the assignment description, plus some of the optional features. The game is implemented in C++ using the SDL library.

## How to play
Use the arrow keys to move the car up, down, left, or right. Press the space bar to shoot at other cars. Press "n" to start a new game, "s" to save the game state, "l" to load a previously saved game, "p" to pause/continue the game, and "esc" to quit the game. The game keeps track of your score and elapsed time, and displays them in the upper part of the screen.

## Features

- Basic functionality of the game: road form with collisions
- Esc and n controls for quitting the game or starting a new one
- Scoring mechanics according to the game's rules
- Not constant width of the road
